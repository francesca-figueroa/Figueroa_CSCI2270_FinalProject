CSCI 2270 Final Project 


Project Summary 

This program is essentially a Vacation+Trip Planner. It is sort of an extension of the Graph Assingnment (#8). The program generates a map (Graph) around which the user can plan a trip. The plan is to add different "weights" to the graph such as distances, time, or cost. The program also allows for different modes of transportation by which the user can travel, as well as overseas travel. The hope for this program, is to generate options for travel routes, as well as suggestions for best travel experience. 

How to Run

The user begins by starting the program and selecting countries that they would like to travel around. Once a map is selected, the program asks a series of questions about the user's travel plans. Examples include things like: 

1. Starting point
2. Ending point
3. Other places they may want to travel in between
4. Mode of transportation
5. User's budget
6. Types of activities they want to do while on their trip 
 
Based on the user's answers the program's job is to suggest options for travel routes, give estimated costs, and compare different modes of transportation, and give suggestions on what they can do in each city. 

Dependencies

Other than standard C++ libraries, like string, cstdlib, iostream, just basic ones like that, there will not be any third-party libraries that need to be installed. The libraries are all included standard in C++.

System Requirements

The program, ideally, will run universally on all systems. It's a pretty basic program, so there are no system requirements.
